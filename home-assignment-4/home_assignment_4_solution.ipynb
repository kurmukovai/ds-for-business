    "In this homework assignment, you will tackle three distinct tasks involving text analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tweet Classification: Predict whether a specific tweet pertains to a natural disaster.\n",
    "2. Bank Q&A Analysis: Deduce the user's query based on the text provided.\n",
    "3. Fake News Classification: Determine whether a piece of news is true or false.\n",

    "For educational reasons, we have retained all utility cells for data downloads. However, you can find everything you need in the corresponding GitHub repository subfolder.\n",

    "# Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Our solution approach will remain relatively consistent for all tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Encode the text using a certain Language Model (LM), transforming each piece of text into a vector.\n",
    "2. Implement a standard classification model (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) using these features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the varied nature of these tasks, you'll find that this approach provides a solid baseline solution for all three."
